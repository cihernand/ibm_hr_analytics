# Lecture for Strategic Planing - Business Intelligence

This repository has python scripts and jupyter notebooks to create visualizations and machine learning models to study counfounder variables and Employee Attrition.

# Admissions to UC Berkely 

This dataset was obtaned from the dslabs R package as a CSV file. It has information about 
the UC Berkeley graduate school admissions data by gender and major from 1973.

The aim to use this dataset is to study counfounder variables to prevent missleading data analysis. The example was obtained from a book, written by Rafal A. Irizarry.

The admission dataset was analyzed by Bickle and O'Connell and they found that when data is agreggated across all majors there is a misleading result that suggests a gender bias: 44% men were admitted compared to 30% women. 

During class we will stratify the admissions by major and we will test the hypothesis of gender bias.


# IBM Human Resources Analytics

Public fictional IBM dataset created by data scientists:

The dataset was downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uniabhi/ibm-hr-analytics-employee-attrition-performance):

During class we will do the following tasks:

- Descriptive Analytics

    * Use IBM dataset to do statistics, plots and tables.
    * Objective: Summarize trends and patterns related to Employee Attrition. 


- Predictive Analytics

    * Use observed data to predict Employee Attrition using Supervised Machine Learning and Decision Trees.

    * Objective: Build a model to undersand the reasons behind Employee Attrition.

- Prescriptive Analytics
   
    * Combine descriptive and predictive insights to achieve specific solutions.

    * Objective: Suggest strategic decisions to reduce Employee Attrition.
