# Admissions to UC Berkely 

This dataset was obtaned form from the dslabs R package as a CSV file. It has information about 
the UC Berkeley graduate school admissions data by gender and major from 1973.

The aim to use this dataset is to study counfounder variables to prevent missleading data analysis. The example was obtained from a book, written by Rafal A. Irizarry.

The admission dataset was analyzed by Bickle and O'Connell and they found that when data is agreggated across all majors there is a misleading result that suggests a gender bias: 44% men were admitted compared to 30% women. 

During class we will stratify the admissions by major and we will test the hypothesis of gender bias.
